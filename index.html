I'd like to introduce myself.
I have already finished all the training for the new employee.
I am still thinking about the ways to send the ECD.
Additionally, it has become easier to communicate with customers than before.
So the number of clients I keep in touch with has increased.
<br><br>
In addition, I am also supporting CTS reporting.
I think my team support has been going well so far, and I will willingly support it whenever the team needs my help.

<p>4.
Currently, I am in the process of acquiring the level 2. I am also working on the 62133-2 project and I am trying not to get a CO comment</p>

5. Next year, I want to do UL 1642 seminar, achieve level 2, and study various specifications. My goal is to get all level 2 within 3 years.

6. I wish I had a regular meeting time

7. When I presented the seminar before, I received good reviews from senior employees. So I think presentation is my strength. I will study the standards hard so that I can have various opportunities to do seminars.

So far, I have completed two seminars on CB62133-2 and witness.
